# Before The Interview
## getting the right experience
without a great **resume**, there is **no** interview, without great **experience, there is no great **resume**.

for current student, maybe can follow this:
  - take the big project classes
  - get an internship, do everything you can to land an intership early in school
  - start something, build a project on your own time, **participate in coding contest**

for professional that trying to move from lesser-known company to on of the "biggest", the following advice will be useful:
  - shift work responsibilities more toward coding: take on bigger coding challenges
  - use your night and weekend: if you have free time, use it to build mobile app, web app, dekstop software

## writing a great resume 
you should prepare your resume to highlight those two things.
### appropriate resume length
keep a resume to **one** page
  - recruiters only spend a fixed amount of time (about 10 seconds) looking at your resume

long resume are not a reflection of having tons of experience, they are reflection of not understanding how to optimize content.
### employment history
include a relevant history of every role you ever had. the ones that make your more impressive candidate
##### writing strong bullets
for each role try to discuss your accomplishments with the following approach "accomplished X by implementing Y which led to Z". heres an example:
  - "reduced object rendering time by 75% by implementing distributed caching, leading to a 10% reduction in log in time"

the point is, show what you did, how you did it, and what the results were.
### project
only include project that make you look better. independent projects are generally preferred over course project, as it shows initiative

do not add too many project, just pick that make you look better.
### programming languages and software
##### software 
look at company that you registered. use software related to the company if there is any software. technical software like visual studio and eclipsesomewhat more relevant.
##### languages
list everything you have ever worked with. or shorten the list to just the ones that you're most comfortable with 
add your experience level.
  - language: python (senior), javascript(mid level), etc
##### advice for non native english speakers and internationals
some companies will throw your resume just because of a typo. please check again with native english speakers to proofed your resume.
##### beware of (potential) stigma
  - enterprise languages
  - being to language focused: dont flaunt to a language
  - certifitation
  - knowing only one or two languages

if your expertise in C#.NET, try to developing some project in Python adn JavaScript, if you only know one or two language, build some application in a different language. 

it's better if you can learn language that are more different, like Python, C++, and Java
